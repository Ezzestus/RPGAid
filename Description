Program Language:
Java?(for ease of cross platform)
open source???? (definitely open api to make modding and plug-ins easy to do/use)

Program code/morals:
DM should be able to override anything and remain in charge as much as they wish.
character creation process should be as streamlined for players as possible.
should be easy to create and use maps with the ability to edit them on the go.

Program features:

cross platform(pc(Linux too), Mac?, mobile?)
LAN
internet
map design/creation(also dungeon)
map should be able to be detailed or vague(FogOfWar?)
should not depend on having a map
edit map on the go
ability to enable disable fog of war(per a player)
ability to set map assets as hidden or secret(players with abilities that reveal these should have them revealed automatically unless DM specifies otherwise.)
character creation
DM mode(meaning view mode?)
player mode
streamlined character creation mode
monster list(DM chosen and community?)
random encounter options
dice?
auto roll listen and spot checks (option to either give players notifications directly or give to DM to tell players at DM discretion)
multi layered terrain
ability for DM to make custom skills players can use
ready to use map assets
ready to use list of races and classes
ability to make custom races/classes
ability to auto generate terrain, npc's, towns, cities, dungeons.(all should be separate auto generate options)
ability to store npc names, whereabouts(perhaps simulate this over time), per player relations.


Coding guidelines:

modules should be separated from each other in such a way that any module can be pulled out and replaced with a different module easily.
 

program modules:

main program module
dice module
ui module

mapping
combat tracker
skills 
item generator
npc
